        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I've loved architecture since I was a little kid. I used to play with those big LEGO Duplo blocks, and I would make the randomest structures ever. Today, I'm still obsessed with LEGOs, but I'm now more fond of following an instruction booklet to create a something like the Millenium Falcon or Hogwarts. I have learned to admire the thought and dedication that goes behind desgining these LEGO sets, and more broadly, the thought behind designing any structure we see in the real world. I'm drawn to architecture because there is so much thought and imagination within that field. I want to explore all that I can. Below are some of my favorite structures in the world, ranging from buildings to bridges to roller coasters and more!</p>

                <p>The Burj Khalifa has always intrigued me because of its sheer height. How were we able to figure out how to build that high? Can we go higher? How high can we go? The building raises so many questions about the limits of architecture, and how far we can truly take our structures.</p>

            <li>Vietnam's Golden Bridge

                <p>This bridge truly shows off the imaginative minds that work to create Earth's beautiful structures. The way designers and architects were able to create hands that look so organic out of a material that looks stark and sharp always amazes me. The math and the calculating into making sure the bridge is supprted well is also inspiring.</p>
